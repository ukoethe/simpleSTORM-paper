  abstract = {A computationally rapid image analysis method, weighted overdetermined
	regression, is presented for two-dimensional (2D) Gaussian fitting
	of particle location with subpixel resolution from a pixelized image
	of light intensity. Compared to least-squares Gaussian iterative
	fitting, which is most exact but prohibitively slow for large data
	sets, the precision of this new method is equivalent when the signal-to-noise
	ratio is high and approaches it when the signal-to-noise ratio is
	low, while enjoying a more than 100-fold improvement in computational
	time. Compared to another widely used approximation method, nine-point
	regression, we show that precision and speed are both improved. Additionally,
	weighted regression runs nearly as fast and with greatly improved
	precision compared to the simplest method, the moment method, which,
	despite its limited precision, is frequently employed because of
	its speed. Quantitative comparisons are presented for both circular
	and elliptical Gaussian intensity distributions. This new image analysis
	method may be useful when dealing with large data sets such as those
	frequently met in astronomy or in single-particle and single-molecule
	tracking using microscopy and may facilitate advances such as real-time
	quantification of microscopy images.},

	* Use least-sqaures to minimize the algebraic distance in the space
	one gets by taking the logarithm of the Gaussian.
	
	* Background must be subtracted from the intensities before fitting.
	
	* Noise is ignored in the fitting model, but used to weight the samples
	according to w = 1 / log((v+n)/(v-n)) = 1 / log((SNR+1) / (SNR-1))
	(where v is the intensity and n the noise standard deviation). Since
	higher intensities have higher SNR (if the noise is independent of
	intensity), they are weighted up by this model. (Note that the weighting
	formula can only be found in the code provided as supplementary).
	
	Empirical results are very good. In particular, the model has a very
	low probability not to converge to a reasonable solution (in contrast
	to Levenberg-Marquart).},

  abstract = {We present a nonparametric regression method for denoising 3-D image
	sequences acquired via fluorescence microscopy. The proposed method
	exploits the redundancy of the 3-D+time information to improve the
	signal-to-noise ratio of images corrupted by Poisson-Gaussian noise.
	A variance stabilization transform is first applied to the image-data
	to remove the dependence between the mean and variance of intensity
	values. This preprocessing requires the knowledge of parameters related
	to the acquisition system, also estimated in our approach. In a second
	step, we propose an original statistical patch-based framework for
	noise reduction and preservation of space-time discontinuities. In
	our study, discontinuities are related to small moving spots with
	high velocity observed in fluorescence video-microscopy. The idea
	is to minimize an objective nonlocal energy functional involving
	spatio-temporal image patches. The minimizer has a simple form and
	is defined as the weighted average of input data taken in spatially-varying
	neighborhoods. The size of each neighborhood is optimized to improve
	the performance of the pointwise estimator. The performance of the
	algorithm (which requires no motion estimation) is then evaluated
	on both synthetic and real image sequences using qualitative and
